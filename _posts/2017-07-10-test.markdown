A quick page to present a project that myself and 4 other team members were a part of earlier this year, the idea was to take social robots (examples of social robots) and make them usefull in 48 hours.

### The team

### The project

#### The robot

### Final thoughts...?

Working for 48 hours straight is a hard task ! Not showering was even harder ! After the ordeal we were happy to receive 1st prize from the jury for our innovating work.

You can find the video presentation we did of the project (yes that is me, and yes I hadn't slept enough...) and the git [here](https://github.com/Hoomano-Hackathon/CozmoIsCute)
