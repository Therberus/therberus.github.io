Earlier this year, [Hoomano](http://hoomano.com/) (a social robotics company based in Lyon - France) held its first "Hackathon", with the tag line "Make me useful in 48h" ! A team composed of myself and 4 fellow students from Lyon 1 university decided it would be a good idea to participate, after all, what could go wrong ?

#### The robot

To be honest, there wasn't much discussion about which robot we would work on during the weekend. The first time we set our eyes on [Cozmo](https://anki.com/fr-fr/cozmo) we were in love, and knew we just had to work on him !

### The project

After a short deliberation, we settled on a project that would take advantage of Cozmos emotions to teach music. Given the small amount of sensors and degrees of freedom that Cozmo possess this project posed quite a challenging task (all in all Cozmo can move its head, arm, and wheels, nothing more, also we quickly discovered that the robot does not posses a microphone, which made the task of listening / evaluating musical notes even harder !)

For user input, we decided to use a little device called a [MakeyMakey](http://www.makeymakey.com/) which allows you to make a keyboard out of just about anything (fruit, tinfoil, sleeping teammates, anything that can conduct electricity !). This also posed quite a few problems (did you know that offical brand playdough conducts electricity, but off-brand stuff doesn't ?!).

### Final thoughts...?

After the 48h of work (with about 5/6 hours of sleep per team member!), we presented our work in front of the jury and were awarded 1st prize ! I can definately say that I will be participating in future hackathons organized by Hoomano !
 
You can find the video presentation we made of the project (yes that is me, and yes I hadn't slept enough...) and the git [here](https://github.com/Hoomano-Hackathon/CozmoIsCute) (the video will be on the repository at a later date!)
