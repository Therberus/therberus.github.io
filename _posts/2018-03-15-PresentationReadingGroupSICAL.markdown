In march 2018 I gave a talk to my collegues about the paper titled : "A practical guide and software for analysing pairwise comparison experiments" written by PÃ©rez-Ortiz and Mantiuk.

You can find the slides used [here] (http://www.stuhallifax.co.uk/projets/A%20practical%20guide%20and%20software%20for%20analysing%20pairwise.pdf) (sorry for the bad formatting of some slides, the presentation was design using PowerPoint, and some of the animations don't translate well to pdf...).
