During the RJC EIAH (Recontres Jeunes Chercheurs en EIAH (Environnements Informatiques pour l'Apprentissage Humain)) I was able to present a talk about my work on the classification of game elements for adaptative structural gamification. 

You can find the slides for the talk (in French!) [here](http://www.stuhallifax.co.uk/projets/Presentation RJC EIAH.pptx), and the corresponding paper in the RJC EIAH acts (also in French!) [here](http://atief.fr/sitesConf/rjceiah2018/doc/ActesRJCEIAH2018.pdf#page=40).
