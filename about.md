<p>I am a PhD student from the <a href="https://liris.cnrs.fr/en">LIRIS</a> lab, <a href="https://liris.cnrs.fr/en/team/sical">SICAL</a> team, based in 
Lyon France. I am currently working on <em>Adaptive gamification of digital teaching resources</em>, under the supervision of <a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/elise.lavoue/">Elise Lavoué</a>, <a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/audrey.serna/">Audrey Serna</a>, and <a href="https://jcmarty.wordpress.com/">Jean-Charles Marty</a></p>

<p>My thesis is a part of the LudiMoodle project, financed by the e-FRAN project, a part of the “Investissements d’Avenir” (PIA2). This project is a joint collaboration between the <a href="https://liris.cnrs.fr/en/team/sical">SICAL</a> and <a href="https://recherche.univ-lyon2.fr/ecp">ECP</a> research teams, the PAPN from Université Lyon3, and the EduNao company. The goals of this project are the conception, testing, and validation of a new type of gamification, an adaptive gamification of digital teaching resources (Moodle) to increase motivation and engagement in secondary school students.
 
During my thesis I will be tasked with defining a model to adapt game elements to learner profiles. After a reviewing literature on the subject, I will need to define:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A trace model, allowing for the collection, analysis, and visualisation of user activity. This information will serve to better understand student profiles, as well as their motivation.</li>
	<li>A game element model containing a collection of appropriate game elements for such environments.</li>
	<li>An adaptation model, that defines a certain number of heuristics that will link student profiles to related game elements. Links that can and should evolve over time.</li>
</ul>

</p>The different theoretical propositions shall be put to the test in real world conditions, in different secondary schools in the Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes region. Mathematics is the chosen subject for these experiments, with a target population of 13 to 14 year olds.</p>
 
<p>The objective of my thesis is therefore the production of a model that allows the adaptation of game elements to learner profiles, based on trace based study, and fixed characteristics identified by questionnaires.</p>
